In 2006 Microsoft was working hard on Google's search toolbar while changing its default search engine for 'Bing' from 'Google'. However, this was not easy, but Pichai succeeded in convincing computer makers so that Google Toolbar could be pre-installed, reducing the impact of Microsoft's inherent changes.
    The success of Google Toolbar gave him the idea of â€‹â€‹developing his own browser. 
    After facing the protests by the then CEO, Eric Schmidt, he was able to meet and trust Google, 
    Larry Page and Sergey Brin's co-founders to launch their own browser.</p>
